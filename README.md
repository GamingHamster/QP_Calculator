> Check out project from Version Control > GitHub

2. On the next screen, fill in all required information (project URL, path, etc). Then click on the ***clone*** button. This will clone the repository to your machine.

3. Open up the project. Download all dependencies and tools required.

4. Connect your phone to your computer via USB. **Make sure to have USB Debugging enabled in your phone's Developer Settings.**

5. Click on the run button in Android Studio. This will be shown as a green play button on the top bar of Android Studio.
