## Ranked Quizzing - How it Works
The way it works is simple. Each person is assigned a score or rating and people play each other. Based on the result, your rating will either rise or fall. But, the amount your score rises or falls is based off the scores of the people you play. Basically, playing a player who is ranked higher than you will yield a higher score gain and losing a game to a player ranked lower than you results in a significant point loss. The system rewards consistently good scores and takes into account by how much you beat a player. Defeating an opponent by 10 points yields a much greater reward than beating a player by 2 points. Each new player starts off with a score of 1000.

## Installation Guide
For the installation, you will need an Android phone, a USB cable and Android Studio installed in your computer. **Keep in mind that these are guidelines and that you may use another method if you so choose.**

1. In the start-up screen for Android Studio, click on: 
> Check out project from Version Control > GitHub

2. On the next screen, fill in all required information (project URL, path, etc). Then click on the ***clone*** button. This will clone the repository to your machine.

3. Open up the project. Download all dependencies and tools required.

4. Connect your phone to your computer via USB. **Make sure to have USB Debugging enabled in your phone's Developer Settings.**

5. Click on the run button in Android Studio. This will be shown as a green play button on the top bar of Android Studio.

6. Select your connected device from the list shown in the next menu. Android Studio will then proceed to configure and install all the files needed for the phone to function.

7. Have fun! (With equations!)

**NOTE: Your phone's antivirus software may flag the app as suspicious. This is becuase of the nature of the Android Studio installation process. THE APP ITSELF DOES NOT CONTAIN A VIRUS.**

## Background
This system was made to make the noble art of quizzing more fun and competetive. Using a custom created system, the QP System (more impressive name pending), we hope that we have made your Pub Quizz nights more enjoyable and professional. The app itself was created to assist the calculation of the points for the system (since the original method of calculation invloved going through an unbeliveably boring set of equations).
